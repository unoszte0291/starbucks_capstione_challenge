# Starbucks capstione challenge
<br>
<b>1. Installations</b><br>
Anaconda, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, math, json, sklearn.cluster, sklearn.preprocessing, sklearn.decomposition, pylab, rcParams<br>
<br>
2. Project Motivation<br>
Through this project, I will try to find hints that can offer better offers to customers by analyzing the data of customers using Starbucks mobile apps.<br>
By understanding the usage of offers offered to mobile apps, you can find tips for making better offers.<br>
<br>
3. File Descriptions<br>
The data used is provided by the <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025">Udacity Data Scientist nanodegree</a> project.<br>
portfolio.json - containing offer ids and meta data about each offer (duration, type, etc.)<br>
profile.json - demographic data for each customer<br>
transcript.json - records for transactions, offers received, offers viewed, and offers completed. <br>
transcript_fin.csv - This is a collection of the data needed for analysis from three files above.<br>
Starbucks_Capstone_notebook.ipynb - This is a file which used to analyze the data. In this file, I am creating a graph of data, cluster analysis, principal component analysis, and recommendation engine. <br>
 <br>

6. Results discussion<br>
1. By making some graphs of completed offer data, the following features can be understood.<br>
2. The following can be understood by cluster analysis and principal component analysis.<br>
3. Recommendation Engine result.<br>
4. Improvement<br>
