<br>
<b>2. Project Motivation</b><br>
This project will analyze the data used in Starbucks mobile apps. By analyzing the usage record of offers provided to customers, we can understand the characteristics of customers and understand what kind of offers are actually used from cluster analysis and principal component analysis. By doing so, I think it will be possible to offer better offers to each and every customer. I would like to take on the challenge of data analysis that will lead customers to spend more inspiring time with Starbucks products.<br>
<br>
<b>3. File Descriptions</b><br>
portfolio.json - containing offer ids and meta data about each offer (duration, type, etc.)<br>
profile.json - demographic data for each customer<br>
transcript.json - records for transactions, offers received, offers viewed, and offers completed. <br>
transcript_fin.csv - This is a collection of the data needed for analysis from three files above.<br>
Starbucks_Capstone_notebook.ipynb - This is a file which used to analyze the data. In this file, I am creating a graph of data, cluster analysis, principal component analysis, and recommendation engine. <br>
<br>

1. By making some graphs of completed offer data, the following features can be understood.<br>
2. The following can be understood by cluster analysis and principal component analysis.<br>
3. Recommendation Engine result.<br>
